    Outputs: `Tuple` comprising various elements depending on the configuration (config) and inputs:
        **last_hidden_state**: ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)``
            Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the model.
        **pooler_output**: ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, hidden_size)``
            Last layer hidden-state of the first token of the sequence (classification token)
            further processed by a Linear layer and a Tanh activation function. The Linear
            layer weights are trained from the next sentence prediction (classification)
            objective during Bert pretraining. This output is usually *not* a good summary
            of the semantic content of the input, you're often better with averaging or pooling
            the sequence of hidden-states for the whole input sequence.
        **hidden_states**: (`optional`, returned when ``config.output_hidden_states=True``)
            list of ``torch.FloatTensor`` (one for the output of each layer + the output of the embeddings)
            of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)``:
            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        **attentions**: (`optional`, returned when ``config.output_attentions=True``)
            list of ``torch.FloatTensor`` (one for each layer) of shape ``(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)``:
            Attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention heads.
    Examples::
        tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
        model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
        input_ids = torch.tensor(tokenizer.encode("Hello, my dog is cute", add_special_tokens=True)).unsqueeze(0)  # Batch size 1
        outputs = model(input_ids)
        last_hidden_states = outputs[0]  # The last hidden-state is the first element of the output tuple
