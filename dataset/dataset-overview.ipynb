In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company's revenues, results of operations, and cash flows have been negatively affected, giving rise to substantial doubts about its ability to continue operations as a going concern.  Compared to the prior year, net sales decreased by 5.4%, resulting in a net loss of $61.6 million as compared to a net income of $4.2 million from comparable store sales.  Increasing promotional activity, a drop in sales leverage, and higher shipping costs led to a decrease in gross profit margin to 28.1% for the company.  Although the company targeted customer acquisition and grow its digital and new brands, it continued to lose money, with operating losses of $61.9 million, significantly impacted by an impairment charge of $20.6 million on store assets.  In February 2020, the company's revolving credit facility had been drawn down by $40 million. This left $43.5 million available.  As a result, management believes that existing cash resources and cash flow from operations will not be sufficient to meet fiscal year 2020's working capital and capital expenditure requirements.  Investors are likely to be left with nothing following a restructuring or bankruptcy filing by RTW Retailwinds.  Precarious financial health and uncertain future prospects threaten the company.    \n",

Excluding divestitures, net sales declined 6.7% due to decreased Swanson U.S. consumption, unfavorable product mix in the Vlasic pickle business, and competitive pressures in the UK. The company recorded a loss from continuing operations of $(28.6) million, significantly impacted by lower sales, reduced gross margins, increased marketing costs, and charges related to trade marketing estimates.   Vlasic Foods is facing a going concern matter due to operating losses and non-compliance with financial covenants under its senior credit facility. The company received a waiver through February 28, 2001, subject to conditions including an escrow deposit for a January 2001 interest payment and repayment of the senior credit facility.  Vlasic has hired Lazard Freres & Co. to explore strategic opportunities, including the potential sale of the company in whole or in parts, to address its financial situation.    The company's ability to operate as a going concern hinges on the successful execution of its strategic plans and the avoidance of default under its senior credit facility. Vlasic's liquidity is strained, relying heavily on borrowings and facing restrictions due to covenant violations. Future performance depends on the outcome of the strategic review, successful divestitures, and the ability to achieve cost savings and improve profitability. Investors should carefully consider the significant risks associated with Vlasic Foods International's financial health and its ability to continue as a going concern.    \n",

Windstream's bankruptcy filing in 2019 raises going concern doubts for Uniti, especially as Windstream's litigation challenges the lease's validity. Uniti and Windstream reached a settlement agreement in March 2020, subject to court approval and other conditions. The settlement includes a $400 million cash payment to Windstream, stock sale proceeds, asset transfers, and revised lease agreements, including $1.75 billion in growth capital investments over 10 years. Uniti's 2019 revenue increased to $1.03 billion, primarily due to lease and fiber infrastructure revenues. The company faced challenges, including Windstream's bankruptcy, litigation costs, and a decline in its Consumer CLEC business, which is being wound down. Uniti relies on its lease agreement with Windstream for a significant portion of its operating cash flow.  To fund operations and growth, Uniti utilizes cash on hand, operating cash flow, and debt financing. Uniti's ability to pay dividends is restricted by debt covenants, and may be further impacted by the settlement with Windstream. Uniti actively manages its capital structure through debt issuance, an at-the-market stock program (currently suspended), and its UPREIT structure. Future capital expenditures are planned for network infrastructure and are categorized as success-based, maintenance, integration, or corporate and non-network.   \n",

In November 2006, the company completed its merger with Ryan's, which is the largest publicly traded buffet restaurant operator in the country, for $834 million, and refinanced its debt with a new $640 million credit facility and $300 million senior note.  As a result of the Ryan's acquisition, restaurant sales increased 49.4% in fiscal year 2007, but the same-store sales of both Buffets and Ryan's brands declined.  A large part of the company's increased costs in food, labor, and direct and occupancy cost can be attributed to the merger.  In addition to increased interest rates, a higher debt balance resulted in higher interest expenses.  On deferred tax assets, the company recorded a tax valuation allowance of $42 million.  This was largely due to increased interest and tax payments, and the Ryan's acquisition took up $180.6 million in cash.  It expects to invest $10-$19 million in capital improvements in 2008, largely in remodeling and improving existing restaurants, including the new Ryan's.

       "      <td>Retailwinds operates 387 specialty women's stores and an eCommerce business under the New York &amp; Company and Fashion to Figure brands.  In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company's revenues, results of operations, and cash flows have been negatively affected, giving rise to substantial doubts about its ability to continue operations as a going concern.  Compared to the prior year, net sales decreased by 5.4%, resulting in a net loss of $61.6 million as compared to a net income of $4.2 million from comparable store sales.  Increasing promotional activity, a drop in sales leverage, and higher shipping costs led to a decrease in gross profit margin to 28.1% for the company.  Although the company targeted customer acquisition and grow its digital and new brands, it continued to lose money, with operating losses of $61.9 million, significantly impacted by an impairment charge of $20.6 million on store assets.  In February 2020, the company's revolving credit facility had been drawn down by $40 million. This left $43.5 million available.  As a result, management believes that existing cash resources and cash flow from operations will not be sufficient to meet fiscal year 2020's working capital and capital expenditure requirements.  Investors are likely to be left with nothing following a restructuring or bankruptcy filing by RTW Retailwinds.  Precarious financial health and uncertain future prospects threaten the company.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Vlasic Foods International experienced a 24.1% decrease in net sales in fiscal 2000, largely due to the divestiture of the Kattus and Swift-Armour businesses. Excluding divestitures, net sales declined 6.7% due to decreased Swanson U.S. consumption, unfavorable product mix in the Vlasic pickle business, and competitive pressures in the UK. The company recorded a loss from continuing operations of $(28.6) million, significantly impacted by lower sales, reduced gross margins, increased marketing costs, and charges related to trade marketing estimates.   Vlasic Foods is facing a going concern matter due to operating losses and non-compliance with financial covenants under its senior credit facility. The company received a waiver through February 28, 2001, subject to conditions including an escrow deposit for a January 2001 interest payment and repayment of the senior credit facility.  Vlasic has hired Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to explore strategic opportunities, including the potential sale of the company in whole or in parts, to address its financial situation.    The company's ability to operate as a going concern hinges on the successful execution of its strategic plans and the avoidance of default under its senior credit facility. Vlasic's liquidity is strained, relying heavily on borrowings and facing restrictions due to covenant violations. Future performance depends on the outcome of the strategic review, successful divestitures, and the ability to achieve cost savings and improve profitability. Investors should carefully consider the significant risks associated with Vlasic Foods International's financial health and its ability to continue as a going concern.</td>\n",
