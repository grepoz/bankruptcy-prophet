The company generated $33.7 million in revenue in 2016, up from $24.5 million in 2015.  Contrave's first US net sales totaled $17.3 million in 2016.  Future sales are difficult to predict at this stage in the company's commercialization process.  Due to costs associated with establishing sales and marketing capabilities, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased slightly.  Unprofitable, the company reports a net loss and expects to continue incurring losses for several years.  Contrave's success is essential to the company's profitability, as it depends on revenue to cover costs.  To support operations, the company may issue equity, debt, or royalty-based agreements, all of which could dilution existing shareholders significantly.  In order for Contrave to be successfully commercialized, needed regulatory approvals must be obtained, as well as adequate funding must be secured.    \n",

The company operates in two segments: EMEA and Americas, with the US and UK being the only countries representing more than 10% of total revenues in fiscal year 2014.  Revenues are generated from sales of software and services under negotiated contracts or pricing agreements, with the core offering being estimating and workflow software. The company has a high customer retention rate due to customer integration and long-standing relationships.  Revenue increased by 17.8% in fiscal year 2014, driven by the acquisition of SRS and organic growth in both segments, particularly in re-underwriting services and transaction-based revenues.  Operating expenses and systems development and programming costs also increased due to acquisitions and investments in product development.  The company actively pursues acquisitions as part of its growth strategy and recently acquired the Insurance and Services Division of Pittsburgh Glass Works. Solera believes its existing cash on hand and cash flow from operations are sufficient to fund working capital, debt service, acquisitions, and strategic investments for at least the next twelve months.  The company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily the Euro, and mitigates this risk through cross-currency swaps.  Factors influencing business volume and revenue include the number of insurance claims, new and used vehicle sales, damaged vehicle repair costs, automobile usage, seasonality, and vehicle insurance penetration rates.   \n",
       "2  The company is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on RNAi therapeutics. They have two approved products, ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI, and six late-stage investigational programs. The company has incurred significant losses since inception and expects losses to continue due to research and development costs. Revenue comes from product sales and collaborations with Regeneron, Sanofi Genzyme, and MDCO.  Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition for product sales and collaborations, inventory capitalization, income tax accounting, stock-based compensation, and research and development accruals. Net product revenue increased in 2019 due to ONPATTRO sales and the launch of GIVLAARI. Collaboration revenue decreased in 2019 but is expected to increase in 2020 due to reimbursable activities and milestones. Operating expenses, including cost of goods sold, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, increased in 2019 due to growth and commercialization activities. The company expects these expenses to continue increasing in 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the company had $1.54 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. They believe this is sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months. However, the company may require additional funding sooner to support commercialization and development activities. Future capital requirements depend on factors such as R&D progress, collaboration agreements, regulatory approvals, and manufacturing capabilities. The company may seek additional funding through collaborations, equity offerings, or debt financing, which could result in dilution or restrictive covenants. The company also has off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily indemnification clauses in license agreements.  Contractual obligations include operating leases, license agreements, and potential milestone payments.    \n",

Its Advertising Inserts segment faces challenges related to industry overcapacity and price pressure.  In spite of acquisitions and volume growth, Direct Mail's EBITDA declined due to a non-cash impairment charge and increased fixed costs.  In addition, their $250 million revolving credit facility will mature in December 2008, and their $130 million accounts receivable facility will mature in February 2009.  The company is exploring refinancing, restructuring, and debt exchange options to stay afloat during its upcoming maturities.  While the company has been in contact with lenders and debtholders, no agreement has been reached so far.  Furthermore, Vertis' independent auditors have qualified it as a going concern.  As part of a restructuring program already yielding results, management is taking steps to cut costs and focus on operational efficiency to improve profitability.  In the future, the company's performance may be affected by market trends, competition, paper costs, and its ability to refinance its debt.    \n",

Acquisitions and growth in communication services helped drive revenues in 2000, but price reductions and industry competition lowered revenues per minute.  Despite the company's network ownership expansion, its cost of services and sales decreased as a percentage of revenue, though gross profit is expected to drop since capacity sales no longer qualify for sales-type lease accounting.  The company's selling, general, and administrative expenses increased as a result of acquisitions, expansions, and restructuring charges, including more accounts receivable reserves.  In 2000, the company reported EBITDA losses and a significant net loss, with high depreciation and amortization costs.  It is facing a difficult economic environment and suspending interest and dividend payments that pose a major concern regarding liquidity.  Restructuring at the company focuses on corporate and Broadband/Enterprise segments, while closing consumer-oriented businesses in several countries and reducing hiring.  If creditors fail to reach an agreement, there is a significant risk of bankruptcy. Creditors are actively seeking restructuring options, including debt-to-equity conversions and exploring strategic alternatives.  Various challenges face the company, such as intense industry competition, regulatory uncertainty, dependence on third-party sales organizations, and the need for additional funding.    "

The company generated $33.7 million in revenue in 2016, up from $24.5 million in 2015.  Contrave's first US net sales totaled $17.3 million in 2016.  Future sales are difficult to predict at this stage in the company's commercialization process.  Due to costs associated with establishing sales and marketing capabilities, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased slightly.  Unprofitable, the company reports a net loss and expects to continue incurring losses for several years.  Contrave's success is essential to the company's profitability, as it depends on revenue to cover costs.  To support operations, the company may issue equity, debt, or royalty-based agreements, all of which could dilution existing shareholders significantly.  In order for Contrave to be successfully commercialized, needed regulatory approvals must be obtained, as well as adequate funding must be secured.</td>\n",

The company operates in two segments: EMEA and Americas, with the US and UK being the only countries representing more than 10% of total revenues in fiscal year 2014.  Revenues are generated from sales of software and services under negotiated contracts or pricing agreements, with the core offering being estimating and workflow software. The company has a high customer retention rate due to customer integration and long-standing relationships.  Revenue increased by 17.8% in fiscal year 2014, driven by the acquisition of SRS and organic growth in both segments, particularly in re-underwriting services and transaction-based revenues.  Operating expenses and systems development and programming costs also increased due to acquisitions and investments in product development.  The company actively pursues acquisitions as part of its growth strategy and recently acquired the Insurance and Services Division of Pittsburgh Glass Works. Solera believes its existing cash on hand and cash flow from operations are sufficient to fund working capital, debt service, acquisitions, and strategic investments for at least the next twelve months.  The company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily the Euro, and mitigates this risk through cross-currency swaps.  Factors influencing business volume and revenue include the number of insurance claims, new and used vehicle sales, damaged vehicle repair costs, automobile usage, seasonality, and vehicle insurance penetration rates.</td>\n",

They have two approved products, ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI, and six late-stage investigational programs. The company has incurred significant losses since inception and expects losses to continue due to research and development costs. Revenue comes from product sales and collaborations with Regeneron, Sanofi Genzyme, and MDCO.  Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition for product sales and collaborations, inventory capitalization, income tax accounting, stock-based compensation, and research and development accruals. Net product revenue increased in 2019 due to ONPATTRO sales and the launch of GIVLAARI. Collaboration revenue decreased in 2019 but is expected to increase in 2020 due to reimbursable activities and milestones. Operating expenses, including cost of goods sold, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, increased in 2019 due to growth and commercialization activities. The company expects these expenses to continue increasing in 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the company had $1.54 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. They believe this is sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months. However, the company may require additional funding sooner to support commercialization and development activities. Future capital requirements depend on factors such as R&amp;D progress, collaboration agreements, regulatory approvals, and manufacturing capabilities. The company may seek additional funding through collaborations, equity offerings, or debt financing, which could result in dilution or restrictive covenants. The company also has off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily indemnification clauses in license agreements.  Contractual obligations include operating leases, license agreements, and potential milestone payments.</td>\n",
