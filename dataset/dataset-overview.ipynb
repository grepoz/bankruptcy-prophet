The company generated $33.7 million in revenue in 2016, up from $24.5 million in 2015.  Contrave's first US net sales totaled $17.3 million in 2016.  Future sales are difficult to predict at this stage in the company's commercialization process.  Due to costs associated with establishing sales and marketing capabilities, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased slightly.  Unprofitable, the company reports a net loss and expects to continue incurring losses for several years.  Contrave's success is essential to the company's profitability, as it depends on revenue to cover costs.  To support operations, the company may issue equity, debt, or royalty-based agreements, all of which could dilution existing shareholders significantly.  In order for Contrave to be successfully commercialized, needed regulatory approvals must be obtained, as well as adequate funding must be secured.    \n",

The company operates in two segments: EMEA and Americas, with the US and UK being the only countries representing more than 10% of total revenues in fiscal year 2014.  Revenues are generated from sales of software and services under negotiated contracts or pricing agreements, with the core offering being estimating and workflow software. The company has a high customer retention rate due to customer integration and long-standing relationships.  Revenue increased by 17.8% in fiscal year 2014, driven by the acquisition of SRS and organic growth in both segments, particularly in re-underwriting services and transaction-based revenues.  Operating expenses and systems development and programming costs also increased due to acquisitions and investments in product development.  The company actively pursues acquisitions as part of its growth strategy and recently acquired the Insurance and Services Division of Pittsburgh Glass Works. Solera believes its existing cash on hand and cash flow from operations are sufficient to fund working capital, debt service, acquisitions, and strategic investments for at least the next twelve months.  The company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily the Euro, and mitigates this risk through cross-currency swaps.  Factors influencing business volume and revenue include the number of insurance claims, new and used vehicle sales, damaged vehicle repair costs, automobile usage, seasonality, and vehicle insurance penetration rates.   \n",
       "2  The company is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on RNAi therapeutics. They have two approved products, ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI, and six late-stage investigational programs. The company has incurred significant losses since inception and expects losses to continue due to research and development costs. Revenue comes from product sales and collaborations with Regeneron, Sanofi Genzyme, and MDCO.  Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition for product sales and collaborations, inventory capitalization, income tax accounting, stock-based compensation, and research and development accruals. Net product revenue increased in 2019 due to ONPATTRO sales and the launch of GIVLAARI. Collaboration revenue decreased in 2019 but is expected to increase in 2020 due to reimbursable activities and milestones. Operating expenses, including cost of goods sold, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, increased in 2019 due to growth and commercialization activities. The company expects these expenses to continue increasing in 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the company had $1.54 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. They believe this is sufficient to fund operations for at least the next 12 months. However, the company may require additional funding sooner to support commercialization and development activities. Future capital requirements depend on factors such as R&D progress, collaboration agreements, regulatory approvals, and manufacturing capabilities. The company may seek additional funding through collaborations, equity offerings, or debt financing, which could result in dilution or restrictive covenants. The company also has off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily indemnification clauses in license agreements.  Contractual obligations include operating leases, license agreements, and potential milestone payments.    \n",

Its Advertising Inserts segment faces challenges related to industry overcapacity and price pressure.  In spite of acquisitions and volume growth, Direct Mail's EBITDA declined due to a non-cash impairment charge and increased fixed costs.  In addition, their $250 million revolving credit facility will mature in December 2008, and their $130 million accounts receivable facility will mature in February 2009.  The company is exploring refinancing, restructuring, and debt exchange options to stay afloat during its upcoming maturities.  While the company has been in contact with lenders and debtholders, no agreement has been reached so far.  Furthermore, Vertis' independent auditors have qualified it as a going concern.  As part of a restructuring program already yielding results, management is taking steps to cut costs and focus on operational efficiency to improve profitability.  In the future, the company's performance may be affected by market trends, competition, paper costs, and its ability to refinance its debt.    \n",

Acquisitions and growth in communication services helped drive revenues in 2000, but price reductions and industry competition lowered revenues per minute.  Despite the company's network ownership expansion, its cost of services and sales decreased as a percentage of revenue, though gross profit is expected to drop since capacity sales no longer qualify for sales-type lease accounting.  The company's selling, general, and administrative expenses increased as a result of acquisitions, expansions, and restructuring charges, including more accounts receivable reserves.  In 2000, the company reported EBITDA losses and a significant net loss, with high depreciation and amortization costs.  It is facing a difficult economic environment and suspending interest and dividend payments that pose a major concern regarding liquidity.  Restructuring at the company focuses on corporate and Broadband/Enterprise segments, while closing consumer-oriented businesses in several countries and reducing hiring.  If creditors fail to reach an agreement, there is a significant risk of bankruptcy. Creditors are actively seeking restructuring options, including debt-to-equity conversions and exploring strategic alternatives.  Various challenges face the company, such as intense industry competition, regulatory uncertainty, dependence on third-party sales organizations, and the need for additional funding.    "

       "      <td>Losses, negative cash flows, and a working capital deficit pose substantial doubts about the company's viability.  Acquisitions and growth in communication services helped drive revenues in 2000, but price reductions and industry competition lowered revenues per minute.  Despite the company's network ownership expansion, its cost of services and sales decreased as a percentage of revenue, though gross profit is expected to drop since capacity sales no longer qualify for sales-type lease accounting.  The company's selling, general, and administrative expenses increased as a result of acquisitions, expansions, and restructuring charges, including more accounts receivable reserves.  In 2000, the company reported EBITDA losses and a significant net loss, with high depreciation and amortization costs.  It is facing a difficult economic environment and suspending interest and dividend payments that pose a major concern regarding liquidity.  Restructuring at the company focuses on corporate and Broadband/Enterprise segments, while closing consumer-oriented businesses in several countries and reducing hiring.  If creditors fail to reach an agreement, there is a significant risk of bankruptcy. Creditors are actively seeking restructuring options, including debt-to-equity conversions and exploring strategic alternatives.  Various challenges face the company, such as intense industry competition, regulatory uncertainty, dependence on third-party sales organizations, and the need for additional funding.</td>\n",

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company's revenues, results of operations, and cash flows have been negatively affected, giving rise to substantial doubts about its ability to continue operations as a going concern.  Compared to the prior year, net sales decreased by 5.4%, resulting in a net loss of $61.6 million as compared to a net income of $4.2 million from comparable store sales.  Increasing promotional activity, a drop in sales leverage, and higher shipping costs led to a decrease in gross profit margin to 28.1% for the company.  Although the company targeted customer acquisition and grow its digital and new brands, it continued to lose money, with operating losses of $61.9 million, significantly impacted by an impairment charge of $20.6 million on store assets.  In February 2020, the company's revolving credit facility had been drawn down by $40 million. This left $43.5 million available.  As a result, management believes that existing cash resources and cash flow from operations will not be sufficient to meet fiscal year 2020's working capital and capital expenditure requirements.  Investors are likely to be left with nothing following a restructuring or bankruptcy filing by RTW Retailwinds.  Precarious financial health and uncertain future prospects threaten the company.    \n",

Excluding divestitures, net sales declined 6.7% due to decreased Swanson U.S. consumption, unfavorable product mix in the Vlasic pickle business, and competitive pressures in the UK. The company recorded a loss from continuing operations of $(28.6) million, significantly impacted by lower sales, reduced gross margins, increased marketing costs, and charges related to trade marketing estimates.   Vlasic Foods is facing a going concern matter due to operating losses and non-compliance with financial covenants under its senior credit facility. The company received a waiver through February 28, 2001, subject to conditions including an escrow deposit for a January 2001 interest payment and repayment of the senior credit facility.  Vlasic has hired Lazard Freres & Co. to explore strategic opportunities, including the potential sale of the company in whole or in parts, to address its financial situation.    The company's ability to operate as a going concern hinges on the successful execution of its strategic plans and the avoidance of default under its senior credit facility. Vlasic's liquidity is strained, relying heavily on borrowings and facing restrictions due to covenant violations. Future performance depends on the outcome of the strategic review, successful divestitures, and the ability to achieve cost savings and improve profitability. Investors should carefully consider the significant risks associated with Vlasic Foods International's financial health and its ability to continue as a going concern.    \n",

Windstream's bankruptcy filing in 2019 raises going concern doubts for Uniti, especially as Windstream's litigation challenges the lease's validity. Uniti and Windstream reached a settlement agreement in March 2020, subject to court approval and other conditions. The settlement includes a $400 million cash payment to Windstream, stock sale proceeds, asset transfers, and revised lease agreements, including $1.75 billion in growth capital investments over 10 years. Uniti's 2019 revenue increased to $1.03 billion, primarily due to lease and fiber infrastructure revenues. The company faced challenges, including Windstream's bankruptcy, litigation costs, and a decline in its Consumer CLEC business, which is being wound down. Uniti relies on its lease agreement with Windstream for a significant portion of its operating cash flow.  To fund operations and growth, Uniti utilizes cash on hand, operating cash flow, and debt financing. Uniti's ability to pay dividends is restricted by debt covenants, and may be further impacted by the settlement with Windstream. Uniti actively manages its capital structure through debt issuance, an at-the-market stock program (currently suspended), and its UPREIT structure. Future capital expenditures are planned for network infrastructure and are categorized as success-based, maintenance, integration, or corporate and non-network.   \n",

In November 2006, the company completed its merger with Ryan's, which is the largest publicly traded buffet restaurant operator in the country, for $834 million, and refinanced its debt with a new $640 million credit facility and $300 million senior note.  As a result of the Ryan's acquisition, restaurant sales increased 49.4% in fiscal year 2007, but the same-store sales of both Buffets and Ryan's brands declined.  A large part of the company's increased costs in food, labor, and direct and occupancy cost can be attributed to the merger.  In addition to increased interest rates, a higher debt balance resulted in higher interest expenses.  On deferred tax assets, the company recorded a tax valuation allowance of $42 million.  This was largely due to increased interest and tax payments, and the Ryan's acquisition took up $180.6 million in cash.  It expects to invest $10-$19 million in capital improvements in 2008, largely in remodeling and improving existing restaurants, including the new Ryan's.
